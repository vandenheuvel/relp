//! # Traits for elements in sparse datastructures
//! 
//! Once a sparse data structure contains references to values, it is not obvious what value should
//! be returned for a zero value, that is not stored. It is also not clear, how one should compare
//! the elements contained in the sparse structure with the zero element (mostly for debug 
//! purposes).
//! 
//! One idea, implemented here, is to have three types related to a sparse data structure:
//! 
//! * The first is the type that is stored many times in the data structure
//! * The second is a type that can be zero (and is not a reference), ideally is small (Copy) and 
//! not stored behind a reference (like `RationalBig`).
//! * The third is the type that both can be dereferenced to. This is used to create a row-major
//! copy of the constraint matrix using references, rather than the actual values.
