//! Different data structures and different algorithms are defined over different spaces. This
//! module defines those spaces and provides implementations.
//!
//! A benefit of this approach is that the algorithms can be tested well for correctness using
//! fractional numbers, while the same code is used without adaptation with floating point numbers.
//! A downside is that the algorithm doesn't have access to the finite representations of e.g.
//! floats, which is potentially limiting.
