//! # Tableau types: artificial or not
//!
//! A tableau can contain artificial variables. They can be used to find a feasible solution in a
//! two-phase algorithm: the first phase finds a basic feasible solution, the second improves it.
//!
//! The `Tableau` type and algorithm logic in the parent modules is independent or whether a tableau
//! contains artificial variables, or not. This module enables those abstractions.
