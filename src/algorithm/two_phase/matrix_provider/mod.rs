/// This is the data of the "problem relative to the initial basis"; that is, nothing in
/// data structures implementing this trait determines a basis. The implementors of this trait
/// should be primarily read-only, with basis changes, the `Carry` fields of the `Tableau`
/// should change instead.
///
/// Note that a this trait doesn't have to be implemented by a (sparse) matrix data structure per
/// se; it could also be implemented by a graph, which lets itself be represented by data in a
/// matrix.
/// The indexing for the variables and constraints is as follows:
///
/// /                 || Vars of which we want a solution | Constraint slack vars | Bound slack vars |
/// ==================||==================================|=======================|==================|-----
/// Constraints       ||            constants             |       constants       |         0        || b |
